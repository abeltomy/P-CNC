# P-CNC
Idea was to develop a Low-cost CNC in Fab lab CUSAT. The rail is made from laser-cut acrylic and the Gantry by 3D printing(PLA). The entire design is modular, and we can take apart the core xy 2d axes The Box type design of the whole setup is made of laser-cut plywood. All the components are easy to assemble and Flexible to transport by part. Uses a core xy kinematic system. This design was inspired by Jake Read MIT CBA.
